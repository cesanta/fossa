== Design Concept

Fossa is a non-blocking, asyncronous event manager described by
`struct ns_mgr` structure. That structure holds active connections.
Connections could be either *listening*, *outbound* or *inbound*.
Outbound connections are created by `ns_connect()` call.
Listening connections are created by `ns_bind()` call.
Inbound connections are those accepted by a listening connection.
Each connection is described by `struct ns_connection` structure, which has
a number of fields like socket, event handler function, send/receive buffer,
flags, et cetera.

`ns_mgr_poll()` should be called in an infinite event loop.
`ns_mgr_poll()` iterates over all sockets, accepts new connections,
sends and receives data, closes connections, and calls an event handler
function for each of those events.

Each connection has send and receive buffer, `struct ns_connection::send_iobuf`
and `struct ns_connection::recv_iobuf` respectively. When data arrives,
Fossa appends received data to the `recv_iobuf` and
triggers `NS_RECV` event. User may send data back (`ns_send()` or
`ns_printf()`), which appends data to the `send_iobuf`. When Fossa
successfully writes data to the socket, it discards it from `send_iobuf` and
sends `NS_SEND` event. When connection is closed, `NS_CLOSE` event is sent.
